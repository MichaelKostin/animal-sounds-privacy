    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted"><em>Last updated: October 12, 2025</em></p>
    <p><strong>App Name:</strong> Animal Sounds: Learn & Play</p>
    <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Mikhail Kostin</p>

    <h2>1. Overview</h2>
    <p>We take your and your child‚Äôs privacy seriously. This app is designed for children and their families. We do <strong>not collect</strong>, <strong>store</strong>, or <strong>share</strong> any personally identifiable information. Our goal is to provide a safe, educational, and fun experience without compromising your privacy.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Names or email addresses</li>
        <li>Photos, videos, or audio recordings</li>
        <li>Location data</li>
        <li>IP address or device identifiers</li>
        <li>Behavioral or usage analytics</li>
        <li>Advertising or tracking information</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
    <p>The app offers optional in-app purchases and subscriptions to unlock additional content. These purchases are handled securely through the official Apple App Store and Google Play billing systems.</p>
    <p>We use a service called <strong>RevenueCat</strong> to securely manage and validate your in-app purchases and subscriptions. RevenueCat only receives non-personal data related to purchase history (such as product identifiers, transaction dates, and subscription status). This information is used solely to maintain access to premium content and synchronize purchases across your devices.</p>
    <p>RevenueCat does <strong>not collect</strong> personally identifiable information such as name, email, or location. All data is encrypted in transit and processed in accordance with Apple and Google privacy requirements.</p>
    <p>For more information, you can review RevenueCat‚Äôs privacy policy:<br>

    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Other than RevenueCat (used only for purchase validation), we do <strong>not use</strong> third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking services. No data is shared with advertisers or data brokers.</p>

    <h2>5. Parental Gate</h2>
    <p>Any links to subscription screens, external websites, or social media are protected by a parental gate. This ensures that children cannot accidentally access content or perform actions intended for adults.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>All purchase-related data processed by RevenueCat is encrypted in transit and stored securely. We do not retain or store this data ourselves. You can request deletion of RevenueCat-associated data by contacting us via email (see below).</p>

    <h2>7. Your Consent</h2>
    <p>By using the app, you consent to this privacy policy and to the limited use of purchase-related data as described above.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or would like to request deletion of purchase-related data, please contact us at:<br>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page and the ‚ÄúLast updated‚Äù date will be revised accordingly.</p>
